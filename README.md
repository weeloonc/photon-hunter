Task 3:
Using the light sensor has many limitations in correctly determining the location of the user. The phone has to be placed facing upwards, or possible only working if the user is looking at the phone. When the phone is angled sideways or downwards, the values recorded will be significantly lower due to lesser amount of light hitting the sensor. Therefore in many places where the amount of light is close to the threshold, it is very likely to have incorrect answers.

Situations where the user could be outdoors but receives an indoor from the application 
    - in a cloudy day or when there are dark clouds, the amount of light could be reduced drastically, and even if the user is to walk outdoors, with the low amount of light, the application could display the wrong location
    - If a user is indoors but sitting under a spot light etc, the light sensor will receive a very high reading to signal that it is outdoors
